# Car Parking Detection

## Overview

Car Parking Detection is an OpenCV-based system that detects and counts vacant and occupied parking spaces in a parking lot using video footage. The system leverages image processing techniques to provide real-time monitoring of parking availability, making it useful for smart parking solutions.

## Features

âœ… **Real-time Parking Space Detection** â€“ Identifies and tracks parking spaces from live video input.
âœ… **Automated Space Counting** â€“ Provides a live count of available and occupied spots.
âœ… **Interactive Parking Space Selection** â€“ Users can manually select and configure parking slots using a Jupyter Notebook.
âœ… **Optimized for Accuracy & Speed** â€“ Achieves up to **95% accuracy**, with a **40% improvement in processing speed** after optimization.
âœ… **Modular & Scalable** â€“ Well-structured codebase with unit testing, making it easy to extend for larger parking lots.

## Tech Stack

- **Python** â€“ Core programming language.
- **OpenCV** â€“ Used for image processing and object detection.
- **NumPy & Pandas** â€“ Assists in handling and processing parking slot data.
- **Jupyter Notebook** â€“ Enables interactive parking space selection.

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/bhupender0415/CarParkingDetection.git
   cd CarParkingDetection
   ```

2. **Create a virtual environment and install dependencies:**

   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Select parking spaces manually:**

   - Open `notebooks/ParkingSpacePicker.ipynb`.
   - Run the notebook and follow the instructions to mark parking slots.

4. **Run the detection system:**

   ```bash
   python src/main.py
   ```

## Example Output

### Parking Lot Detection in Action

The system will highlight each parking space and classify it as **Occupied** (Red) or **Vacant** (Green).
